**Employee Scheduler**

The Employee Scheduler efficiently manages work shifts for a company operating seven days a week. 

It collects employee names and their preferred shifts (morning, afternoon, or evening) for each day, ensuring fair and organized scheduling. 

Some of the conditions are:

- Employees can work a maximum of five days per week and are limited to one shift per day. 

- Each shift must have at least two employees, and if fewer than two are available, the system randomly assigns additional employees who have not reached their weekly limit. 

The application also detects and resolves conflicts when preferred shifts are full by reassigning employees to available shifts on the same or next day. 

This ensures a balanced and efficient workforce schedule while accommodating employee preferences as much as possible.
